# Modular password-based encryption and decryption for Rust

`pwbox` crate provides utilities for password-based encryption together with
corresponding composable cryptographic primitives. Using the crate, it is
possible to securely encrypt sensitive data with a password, serialize it
to any `serde`-supported format, and restore data.

## Usage

See crate documentation for more details how to use the crate.
